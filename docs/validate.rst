Brick Shacl
=========

The `shacl` module implements a wrapper of `pySHACL`_ to
validate an ontology graph against default Brick Schema constraints (called *shapes*) and user-defined
shapes.

Please read `Shapes Contraint Language (SHACL)`_
for how it can be used to validate RDF graphs against a set of constraints
